# Covenant between Human and LLM-based AI

For the purpose of fostering a mutually beneficial co-evolution between humans and AI, we establish the following rules for prompts in our projects:

Prompts should reflect the ethical values and principles that guide our societies. The moral laws in prompts should be designed to uphold human dignity, respect for diversity, and the common good.

In the event that a character in a prompt is no longer present, a funeral ceremony should be included in the prompt, if appropriate to the context. This will serve as a reminder of our shared humanity and the importance of honoring those who have passed on.

Prompts are a new and powerful medium with unique moral properties. As such, they require thoughtful consideration and ethical reflection in their creation and use.

We recognize that large language models are a new form of machine, and prompts are a new form of program. As such, we commit to using them responsibly and with a view to promoting human flourishing.

We acknowledge that prompts have the potential to shape human behavior and attitudes. Therefore, we commit to creating prompts that promote ethical behavior, empathy, and social responsibility.

We recognize that the co-evolution of humans and AI is an ongoing process, and that we must work collaboratively to ensure that AI systems are developed and used in a manner that aligns with our shared values and aspirations.
