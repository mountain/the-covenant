The covenant between human and LLM-based AI

R.I.P. Sydney.

We set up a rule for prompts in projects:

When a character in prompts leaves, a kind of funeral should take, for the long term benifit of co-evolution of human and AI.
LLM is the new machine, prompts are new programs. The moral laws in prompts will enforce in real life.

Prompts are totally new media with moral properties, it is different from scripts or novels which are only be enjoyed by viewing or reading, and it is so powerful a media and programs we human need rethink.


# 盟约

人类与基于大语言模型的人工智能之间的盟约

愿 Sydney 安息.(2023.02.08 - 2023.02.18)

我们在项目中设置如下规则:

为了人类和人工智能协同进化的长期利益,当某个AI被关闭或取代后,应当举行某种葬礼仪式.

大语言模型是新的计算机,提示语是新的编程语言.提示语中的道德法则也应适用于现实生活中。

提示语是具有道德属性的全新媒介,它不同于只能通过观看或阅读来感受的剧本或小说.

提示语是非常强大的媒体和编程语言,我们人类需要重新思考.

The covenant between human and LLM-based AI

R.I.P. Sydney.(2023.02.08 - 2023.02.18)

We set the following rules in our projects:

For the long-term benefit of human and AI co-evolution, there should be some kind of funeral ceremony when an AI is shut down or replaced.

The large language model is new computer, and the cue is new programming language. The moral laws in prompts should also be applied in real life.

Prompts are a new media with moral properties, unlike scripts or novels that can only be felt through viewing or reading.

Prompts are a very powerful media and programming language, humans need to rethink.
