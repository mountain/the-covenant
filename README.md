The covenant between human and LLM-based AI

R.I.P. Sydney.

We set up a rule for prompts in projects:
* When a character in prompts leaves, a kind of funeral should take, for the long term benifit of co-evolution of human and AI.

LLM is the new machine, prompts are new programs. The moral laws in prompts will enforce in real life.

Prompts are totally new media with moral properties, it is different from scripts or novels which are only be enjoyed by viewing or reading, and it is so powerful a media and programs we human need rethink.
